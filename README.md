## Modules

This project is composed by 3 main modules:

### The `cli` module

Which is in charge of gathering command-line arguments and options

### The `config` module

Defines the shape of the HTTP server configuration. This module acts on an input
(the `cli` for instance), to build an instance of `Config`, which is then passed to
the `server` module

### The `server` module

The main logic for the _HTTP Server_. This module must receive a `Config` instance
which is used to build an _HTTP Server_ instance, and then binds the server process
to the specified socket address.
