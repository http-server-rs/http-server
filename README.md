## Request Handlers

This HTTP Proxy supports different _Request Handlers_, this determines how each
incoming HTTP request must be handled, they can't be combinable so you must
choose one based on your needs.

- [File Server](#file-server-handler)
- [Proxy](#proxy-handler)

### File Server Handler

Useful for serving files in the provided directory. Navigation is scoped to the
specified directory, if no directory is provided the CWD will be used.

> This is the default behavior for the HTTP server.

### Proxy Handler

Proxies requests to the provided URL. The URL provided is used as the base URL
for incoming requests.

## References

The following are some relevant details on features supported by this HTTP Server
solution that may be of the interest of the user.

### Compression

Even when compression is supported, by default the server will not compress any
HTTP response contents.

You must specify the compression configuration you want to use, as of today
the server only supports compression with the GZip algorithm, but `brotli` is
also planed to be supported, that's why theres two ways to configure this
server to use compression.

The following MIME types will be skipped from compression:

- `application/gzip`
- `application/octet-stream`
- `application/wasm`
- `application/zip`
- `image/*`
- `video/*`

#### The Configuration File's Compression Section

As suppport for other compression algorithms is planned to be provided in the
future, the configuration file already supports compression settings.

```toml
[compression]
gzip = true
```

#### The `--gzip` flag

Provide the `--gzip` argument to the server when executing it.

```bash
http-server --gzip
```

### TLS (HTTPS)

The TLS solution supported for this HTTP Server is built with [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls)
crate along with [hyper-rustls](https://github.com/ctz/hyper-rustls).

When running with TLS support you will need:

- A certificate
- A RSA Private Key for such certificate

A script to generate certificates and keys is available here [tls-cert.sh](./docs/tls-cert.sh).
This script relies on `openssl`, so make sure you have it installed in your system.

Run `http-server` as follows:

```sh
http-server --tls --tls-cert <PATH TO YOUR CERTIFICATE> --tls-key <PATH TO YOUR KEY> --tls-key-algorithm pkcs8
```

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

This HTTP Server brings support to CORS headers _out of the box_.
Based on the headers you want to provide to your HTTP Responses, 2
different methods for CORS configuration are available.

By providing the `--cors` option to the `http-server`, CORS headers
will be appended to every HTTP Response, allowing any origin.

For more complex configurations, like specifying an origin, a set of allowed
HTTP methods and more, you should specify the configuration via the configuration
TOML file.

The following example shows all the options available, these options are
mapped to the server configuration during initialization.

```toml
[cors]
allow_credentials = false
allow_headers = ["content-type", "authorization", "content-length"]
allow_methods = ["GET", "PATCH", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
allow_origin = "example.com"
expose_headers = ["*", "authorization"]
max_age = 600
request_headers = ["x-app-version"]
request_method = "GET"
```

### Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is supported to deny requests when credentials are invalid.
You must provide the allowed `username` and `password` either by using the CLI
options `--username` along with the desired username and `--password` along with
the desired password, or by specifying such values through the configuration
TOML file.

```toml
[basic_auth]
username = "John"
password = "Appleseed"
```

### Proxy

The HTTP Server is able to proxy requests to an specified URL.

By using the proxy the FileExplorer wont be available, the proxy is considered
a _Request Handler_.

The config TOML file can be used to provide proxy configurations:

```toml
[proxy]
url = "https://example.com"
```

## Roadmap

The following roadmap list features to provide for the version `v1.0.0`.

This roadmap still open for suggestions, if you find that theres a missing
feature in this list, you would like to work on or expect for the first
stable release, please contact software editors by opening an issue or a
discussion.

If you want to contribute to one of these, please make sure
theres an issue tracking the feature and ping me. Otherwise
open an issue to be assigned and track the progress there.

## Release

In order to create a release you must push a Git tag as follows

```sh
git tag -a <version> -m <message>
```

**Example**

```sh
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "First release"
```

> Tags must follow semver conventions
> Tags must be prefixed with a lowercase `v` letter.

Then push tags as follows:

```sh
git push origin main --follow-tags
```
